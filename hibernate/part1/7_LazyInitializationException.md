If you work with Spring Boot and Hibernate, you may have seen this error:

```yaml
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session
```

At first, it can look confusing or scary. But the reason is simple: you are trying to access lazy-loaded data after Hibernate has closed the session.
