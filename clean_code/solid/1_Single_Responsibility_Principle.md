# Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change:

- It does just one task.
- All its methods help with that task.
- When a class has only one job, you seldom must change it.
- Keep methods that belong together in the same class.
- If a class does too many things, its parts get tangled and become hard to fix.
- Always ask: ‚ÄúDoes each method match the class‚Äôs name and purpose?‚Äù

If a method does something different, move it to a class where it fits.

### Example: Book class

#### Non-compliant version

Here, the Book class both holds data and exports to `PDF` or `EPUB`. That means it has more than one reason to change, which breaks the 
`Single Responsibility Principle`.

```java
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Getter
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class Book {
    private final String title;
    private final String author;
    private final String content;

    public void exportToPdf() {
        // code to create PDF
    }

    public void exportToEpub() {
        // code to create EPUB
    }
}
```

- **Issue:** Changing export code forces you to edit Book.
- **Consequence:** The class is harder to maintain and test.

### Compliant version

We refactor so that Book only stores data. Exporting belongs in separate classes.

**Book holds data only**


```java
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Getter
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class Book {
    private final String title;
    private final String author;
    private final String content;
}
```

**Define a generic exporter**

```java
public interface BookExporter {
    void export(Book book);
}
```

**PDF Exporter:**

```java
public final class PdfExporter implements BookExporter {
    @Override
    public void export(Book book) {
        // code to create PDF
    }
}
```

**EPUB exporter**

```java
public final class EpubExporter implements BookExporter {
    @Override
    public void export(Book book) {
        // code to create EPUB
    }
}
```

### Benefits of this design

- **One responsibility per class:** Each class has a single, clear job.
- **Easier to extend:** To add a new format (e.g. HTML), just create another exporter‚Äîno changes to Book.
- **Simpler testing:** You can test export logic separately from book data.

With this structure, every class has exactly one reason to change.
