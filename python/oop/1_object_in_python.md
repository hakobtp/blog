# Objects in Python

In Python, **everything is an object** — numbers, text, lists, even functions.
You might not notice this right away because Python hides most of the technical details behind a simple and friendly syntax.


For example, if you write:

```py
score = 10
```

you are actually creating an object of type `int` (integer) with the value `10`. Then, Python links 
the name `score` to that object. You don’t need to think about the “internal machinery” unless you want to build your own objects 
or change how existing ones behave.

## What is an object?

An object is a special kind of data structure that can hold both:
- **Data** → stored in variables called attributes.
- **Code** → stored in functions called methods.

You can imagine objects as `nouns` (things) and methods as `verbs` (actions).

For example:
- A `Book` object might have attributes like `title` and `pages`.
- It might have methods like `open()` and `read_page()`.
