# Objects in Python

In Python, **everything is an object** — numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, even functions.
You might not always see it because Python hides most of the technical details behind its simple syntax.

For example:
```py
score = 10
```

Here’s what actually happens:

- Python creates an object of type `int` with the value `10`.
- The name `score` is linked to that object.

You don’t normally need to worry about how Python builds objects unless you want to:
- Create your own objects.
- Change the way existing ones behave.

## What exactly is an object?

An object is a container that can hold:
- **Data** → stored in variables called attributes.
- **Code** → stored in functions called methods.

You can think of:
- Objects as nouns (things).
- Methods as verbs (actions).

For example:
- A `Book` object might have `title` and `pages` as attributes.
- It might have `open()` and `read_page()` as methods.

Every object is created from a class, which acts as a blueprint.
