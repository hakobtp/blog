# Loops

In this guide you’ll learn how to repeat actions in Python with `while` and `for`. 
You’ll also learn how `break`, `continue`, and the special `else` on loops work. The examples are simple and practical.

## Why loops matter

Loops help you run the same code many times. They save time, reduce mistakes, and make programs clear. 
You can use loops to process a list of items, read user input until a keyword, or search for something inside data.

## When to use each loop

- Use `for` when you already have a collection (a list, a string, a file) or a known range of numbers. You say: “Go through each item.”
- Use `while` when you want to repeat until a condition changes. You say: “Keep going while this is true.”

> **TIP:** If you can count or iterate through items, prefer `for`. If you are waiting for a condition (e.g., user types stop), prefer `while`.
