When starting a new Python project, managing dependencies and environment-specific settings is crucial to avoid 
**“It works on my machine”** problems. In this post, we’ll cover:

- **Virtual environments (venv):** what they are, why they matter, and how to set them up.
- **.env files:** storing sensitive or environment-specific variables safely.
- **requirements.txt:** pinning Python packages for reproducible installs.
- **environment.yml:** using Conda to manage both Python and non-Python dependencies, including best practices and key differences from `requirements.txt`.
