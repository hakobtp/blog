# Understanding CASCADE in PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, the **CASCADE** option is a powerful tool for managing dependencies between tables and other database objects. 
It ensures data integrity by automatically propagating changes—such as deletions or updates—across related rows and objects. 
In this post, we’ll explore how CASCADE works in the context of foreign key constraints and **DROP** commands, review 
alternatives, and discuss best practices.
