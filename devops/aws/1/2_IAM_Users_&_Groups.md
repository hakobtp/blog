# IAM: Users & Groups

So, **IAM** stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a global service because in IAM we create users and put them into groups.

- IAM means Identity and Access Management.
- IAM is a global service. This means users and groups work in all regions, not just one.
- The root account is made when you create your AWS account. Do not use it for daily work and do not share it.
- Users are people or apps in your organization. You can put users into groups.
- Groups can only have users. They cannot have other groups.
- A user does not need to be in a group, and a user can be in many groups.
