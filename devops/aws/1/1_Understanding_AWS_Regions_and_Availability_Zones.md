# Understanding AWS Regions and Availability Zones

One of the first things you must learn in AWS is the idea of regions.
Regions are places around the world where AWS has large groups of data centers.
Each region has a specific name, such as:

- **us-east-1** (Northern Virginia, USA)
- **eu-west-3** (Paris, France)

A region is not just one building. It is a cluster of data centers located close to each other, 
usually in the same geographic area—for example, Ohio, Sydney, Singapore, or Tokyo.
