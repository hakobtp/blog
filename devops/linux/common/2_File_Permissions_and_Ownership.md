# File Permissions and Ownership

Linux controls who can access and modify files using a **permission system**.
Knowing how permissions work helps you protect your files and avoid unwanted changes.

## The Permission Model in Linux

Every file and folder in Linux has three types of owners:

| Owner Type | Who It Is                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**   | The person who owns the file (usually the one who created it) |
| **Group**  | A set of users with shared access rights                      |
| **Others** | Anyone else on the system                                     |
