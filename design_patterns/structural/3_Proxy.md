The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern. It is one of the simplest patterns to understand and use.

The Gang of Four defines the proxy pattern as:

> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

In other words, a proxy acts as a gatekeeper. It sits between a client and a real object. The proxy can:

- Check permissions before operations
- Log or monitor requests
- Limit or modify access
- Cache results or delay object creation

This helps you protect sensitive actions or manage resource use without changing the real object or the client code.

This class diagram illustrates the structure of the Proxy pattern:

- `CommandExecutor` is an interface defining `runCommand(cmd)`.
- `CommandExecutorImpl` is the real object that implements `CommandExecutor`.
- `CommandExecutorProxy` also implements `CommandExecutor` and controls access before delegating to the real implementation.
- The Client uses the proxy rather than the real object directly, ensuring safe access.

## Example: Command Executor

Imagine a class that runs system commands. If you give it directly to a client, they could run dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`. 
We can use a proxy to prevent that.

**CommandExecutor Interface:**
```java
public interface CommandExecutor {
    void runCommand(String cmd) throws Exception;
}
```

**Real Command Executor:**
```java
public class CommandExecutorImpl implements CommandExecutor {
    @Override
    public void runCommand(String cmd) throws UnauthorizedException, CommandExecutionException {
        // Execute the system command
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
        System.out.println("Executed: '" + cmd + "'");
    }
}
```

**Proxy Class:**
```java
public class CommandExecutorProxy implements CommandExecutor {
    private static final String ADMIN_USER = "Gurgen";
    private static final String ADMIN_PWD = "J@urnalD$v";

    private final CommandExecutor executor;
    private final boolean isAdmin;

     public CommandExecutorProxy(String user, String pwd) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(user, "user cannot be null");
        Objects.requireNonNull(pwd,  "pwd cannot be null");

        this.executor = new CommandExecutorImpl();
        this.isAdmin  = ADMIN_USER.equals(user) && ADMIN_PWD.equals(pwd);
    }

    @Override
    public void runCommand(String cmd) throws UnauthorizedException, CommandExecutionException {
        Objects.requireNonNull(cmd, "cmd cannot be null");
        String trimmed = cmd.trim();

        if (!isAdmin && trimmed.startsWith("rm")) {
            throw new UnauthorizedException("Permission denied: non‚Äëadmin users cannot execute 'rm' commands.");
        }

        try {
            executor.runCommand(cmd);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new CommandExecutionException("Error executing command: " + trimmed, e);
        }
    }
}
```

**Client Code:**
```java
public class ProxyPatternTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommandExecutor executor = new CommandExecutorProxy("Gurgen", "wrong_pwd");
        try {
            executor.runCommand("ls -ltr");
            executor.runCommand("rm -rf abc.pdf");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The client uses `CommandExecutorProxy` instead of `CommandExecutorImpl`.
- The proxy allows safe commands for all users.
- It blocks dangerous commands for non-admin users.

**Sequence Diagram**

</p>

This sequence diagram shows how the Proxy handles a client request:

- The Client calls `runCommand(cmd)` on the `CommandExecutorProxy`.
- The Proxy checks if the user is an admin:
    - If `admin`, it delegates the call to `CommandExecutorImpl` and returns the result.
    - If not `admin`, it throws an exception for disallowed commands.


## Common Uses of Proxy Pattern

- **Virtual Proxy (Lazy Initialization):** Delay creating a heavy object until it is really needed.
- **Protection Proxy (Access Control):** Allow only certain clients to use the object.
- **Remote Proxy (Remote Service):** Handle network communication to a remote object.
- **Logging Proxy:** Log each request before passing it to the real object.
- **Caching Proxy:** Cache results of expensive operations and reuse them.
- **Smart Reference:** Track and manage the lifecycle of a service object, freeing resources when no one uses it.

## Consequences

Pros:
- Control access without changing the original object.
- Add features (logging, caching, security) transparently.
- Delay object creation and save resources.
- Follow the Open/Closed Principle: you can add new proxies without changing existing code.

Cons:
- More classes to manage, which can lead to complexity.
- Extra layer may add some performance overhead.

## Relation to Other Patterns

- Adapter provides a different interface to an object. Proxy uses the same interface.
- Decorator adds responsibilities to an object. Proxy controls or manages access to the object.
- Facade simplifies access to a group of objects. Proxy controls access to a single object.
