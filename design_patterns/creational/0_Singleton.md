# Singleton

The Singleton Pattern in Java is a popular design pattern. It belongs to the group called Creational Design Patterns, which focus on ways to create objects.
At first, the idea of a singleton looks very simple. But when we try to use it in real projects, some extra problems appear.

In this article, we will:

- Learn the main ideas behind the Singleton Pattern.
- Explore different ways to write it in Java.
- Look at common mistakes and best practices.

## Principles of the Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern follows a few rules:

1. **Only one object** of the class is created inside the Java program.
2. **Global access point:** there must be a simple way for other parts of the program to get that object.
3. Singletons are useful when we need to share resources like:
    - Logging tools (to record errors and messages).
    - Database connections.
    - Caches (to store temporary data).
    - Thread pools (to manage groups of threads).

Think of a singleton as a cityâ€™s power station: the city only needs one, and everyone connects to it.
