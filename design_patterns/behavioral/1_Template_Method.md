The **Template Method** pattern is a **behavioral** design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a single, 
**final** method, deferring specific steps to subclasses. It ensures the overall sequence remains unchanged while allowing 
subclasses to customize individual steps.

## Example: Beverage Preparation

Consider preparing different caffeine beverages (e.g., tea vs. coffee). The algorithm involves these fixed steps:

1) Boil water
2) Brew the beverage
3) Pour into cup
4) Add condiments
