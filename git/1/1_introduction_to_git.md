# Introduction to Git

Git is a tool that helps you track changes in your projects and work together with others. In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to create repositories, manage branches, handle conflicts, and collaborate effectively.

## Setting Up Git

Before using Git, you should tell it your name and email. These details will appear in your commits:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Alice Johnson"
git config --global user.email "alice.johnson@example.com"
git config --list
```
