Imagine SoundWave, an online store that sells digital music and physical albums. Currently, SoundWave uses a classic three-layer architecture: a web interface, a backend server handling business logic, and a database storing all the data. Each layer is managed by a separate team: the frontend team manages the website, the backend team manages the server, and the database team handles storage.

Now, SoundWave wants to add a simple feature: letting users choose their favorite music genre. On paper, this seems easyâ€”but in our current setup, it touches all three layers. The web interface must show the genre options, the backend must process changes, and the database must store the new information. Each team must update their part and deploy it in the correct order. Even a small change becomes complex and slow because work is spread across multiple teams.
