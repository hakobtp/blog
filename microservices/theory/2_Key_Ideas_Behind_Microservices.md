# Key Ideas Behind Microservices

When learning about microservices, there are some important ideas to understand. These ideas are often overlooked, but they are essential to know if you want microservices to work well in your projects.

## Independent Deployability

The first key idea is independent deployability. This means you can change one microservice, deploy it, and release it to users without touching any other microservice.

Think of it like updating a single app on your phone without needing to update all your apps at the same time. The concept is simple but tricky to do correctly. If you focus on this idea, many other benefits naturally follow.

To make microservices independently deployable, they must be loosely connected. In other words, one service should work on its own and not rely on the internal details of another service. This requires clear and stable agreements between services, often called APIs. Sharing databases between services is usually a bad idea because it creates tight connections that make independent deployment harder.

For example, imagine you have an online bookstore. One microservice manages books, another manages orders, and a third manages users. If the book service wants to show how many books are available, it should ask the order service for current orders instead of reading the order database directly. This keeps each service independent and easier to update.

## Designing Around Business Domains

Microservices are most effective when they are designed around real-world business domains, not just technical layers. This idea comes from domain-driven design, which helps organize software to match how the business works.

For instance, in a food delivery app, one microservice could handle restaurants, another could handle delivery drivers, and another could manage orders. Each service represents a slice of real-world functionality.

This approach makes it easier to add new features without touching multiple services. Changing one service is faster and less risky than coordinating updates across several services.

Contrast this with older layered architectures, like a typical three-tier system (UI, application logic, database). A simple UI change may require updating multiple layersâ€”making even small updates complicated. By focusing on business functionality instead of technical layers, microservices let you implement changes more efficiently.
