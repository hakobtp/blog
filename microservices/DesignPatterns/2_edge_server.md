# Edge server

When building a system with many microservices, sometimes you want to let external clients access only certain services 
(like a mobile app or web front-end), while keeping other services private inside your system. You also want to protect your 
services from malicious users who might try to abuse them. This is where the Edge Server pattern comes in.
