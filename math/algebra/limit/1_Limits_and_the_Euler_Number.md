# Limits and the Euler Number


Mathematics is full of concepts that might seem abstract at first but are crucial for 
understanding the natural world and various scientific principles. Two such concepts are the limit (often
denoted as _lim_) and the Euler number (denoted as _e_). Letâ€™s explore what these mean in simple
terms and how they relate to each other.

## What is a Limit?

A limit is a fundamental idea in mathematics that describes the value that a function or
sequence _approaches_ as the input gets closer to a certain point. Think of a limit as a destination
that a function or a series of numbers is trying to reach, even if it never actually gets there.
