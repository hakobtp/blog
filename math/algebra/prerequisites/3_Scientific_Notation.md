# Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is a way to write very large or very small numbers more simply. We use powers of ten to do this.

1. **Choose the first digit**
    - Write the number so there is one nonzero digit before the decimal point.
    - This gives a new number between 1 and 10.
2. **Count the moves**
    - Count how many places you moved the decimal point. Call this number **n**.
3. **Write the power of ten**
    - If you moved the decimal to the left, **n** is positive.
    - If you moved the decimal to the right, **n** is negative.    
4. **Combine them**
    - The result is: $$(newNumber) \times 10^n$$


Example 1: A large number
- Original number: 4567834
- Move the decimal point left 6 times: 4.567834
- Exponent: +6 (because we moved left)
- Scientific notation: $$4.567834 \times 10^6$$

Example 2: A very small number
- Original number: 0.00000000000235 
- Move the decimal point right 12 times: 2.35
- Exponent: −12 (because we moved right)
- Scientific notation: $$2.35 \times 10^{-12}$$

> A number is written in scientific notation if it has the form $$a\times 10^n$$ where $$1\le a < 10$$
