## The Product Rule of Powers

 
When you multiply powers with the same base, keep the base and add the exponents:  

$$
    a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
$$

**Example:**  Multiply $$x^3$$ by $$x^4$$:  

$$
    x^3 \times x^4 
    = (x \times x \times x) \times (x \times x \times x \times x) 
    = x^7
$$

Use this rule to make expressions with the same base simpler by adding the exponents instead of writing out each factor.
