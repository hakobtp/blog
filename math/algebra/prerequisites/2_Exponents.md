**Product Rule**

When you multiply powers with the same base, keep the base and add the exponents:  

$$
    a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
$$

**Example:**  Multiply $$x^3$$ by $$x^4$$:  

$$
    x^3 \times x^4 
    = (x \times x \times x) \times (x \times x \times x \times x) 
    = x^7
$$

Use this rule to make expressions with the same base simpler by adding the exponents instead of writing out each factor.

**The Quotient Rule of Exponents**

For any real number **a** and natural numbers **m** and **n** such that **m > n**, 
the quotient rule of exponents states that

$$

\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}

$$

---

**The Power Rule of Exponents**

For any real number **a** and positive integers **m** and **n**, the power rule of exponents states that

$$

(a^m)^n=a^{m \cdot n}

$$

**The Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents**

For any nonzero real number **a**, the zero exponent rule of exponents states that

$$
a^0 = 1
$$

---

**The Negative Rule of Exponents**

For any nonzero real number **a** and natural number **n** the negative rule of exponents states that

$$

a^{-n}= \frac{1}{a^n}

$$

**The Power of a Product Rule of Exponents**

For any real numbers **a** and **b** and any integer **n**, the power of a product rule of exponents states that

$$
(ab)^n = a^n \cdot b^n
$$

**The Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents**

For any real numbers **a** and **b** and any integer **n**, the power of a quotient rule of exponents states that

$$

 \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}
