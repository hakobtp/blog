## The Product Rule of Powers

When you multiply two expressions that have the same base, you simply add their exponents.

> **Product Rule**  
> When you multiply powers with the same base, keep the base and add the exponents:  
> $$
>   a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
> $$

## Using the Product Rule of Exponents

Consider the product $$x^3\cdot x^4$$ Both terms have the same base, **x**, but they are raised to different exponents. Expand each
expression, and then rewrite the resulting expression.

$$
x^3\cdot x^4 = (x\cdot x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x) = x^7
$$

Notice that the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the terms. In other words, when multiplying
exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and add the exponents. This is
the product rule of exponents.

$$
a^m \cdot a^n=a^{m+n}
$$

We can use the product rule of exponents to simplify
expressions that are a product of two numbers or expressions with the same base but different exponents.
