**Product Rule**

When you multiply powers with the same base, keep the base and add the exponents:  

$$
    a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
$$

**Example:**  Multiply $$x^3$$ by $$x^4$$:  

$$
    x^3 \times x^4 
    = (x \times x \times x) \times (x \times x \times x \times x) 
    = x^7
$$

Use this rule to make expressions with the same base simpler by adding the exponents instead of writing out each factor.

**The Quotient Rule of Exponents**

For any real number **a** and natural numbers **m** and **n** such that **m > n**, 
the quotient rule of exponents states that

$$

\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}

$$

---

**The Power Rule of Exponents**

For any real number **a** and positive integers **m** and **n**, the power rule of exponents states that

$$

(a^m)^n=a^{m \cdot n}

$$

---

**The Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents**

For any nonzero real number **a**, the zero exponent rule of exponents states that

$$
a^0 = 1
$$

---

**The Negative Rule of Exponents**

For any nonzero real number **a** and natural number **n** the negative rule of exponents states that

$$

a^{-n}= \frac{1}{a^n}

$$

**The Power of a Product Rule of Exponents**

For any real numbers **a** and **b** and any integer **n**, the power of a product rule of exponents states that

$$
(ab)^n = a^n \cdot b^n
$$

**The Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents**

For any real numbers **a** and **b** and any integer **n**, the power of a quotient rule of exponents states that

$$

 \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}

$$

### Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is a way to write very large or very small numbers more simply. We use powers of ten to do this.

1. **Choose the first digit**
    - Write the number so there is one nonzero digit before the decimal point.
    - This gives a new number between 1 and 10.
2. **Count the moves**
    - Count how many places you moved the decimal point. Call this number **n**.
3. **Write the power of ten**
    - If you moved the decimal to the left, **n** is positive.
    - If you moved the decimal to the right, **n** is negative.    
4. **Combine them**
    - The result is: $$(newNumber) \times 10^n$$


Example 1: A large number
- Original number: 4567834
- Move the decimal point left 6 times: 4.567834
- Exponent: +6 (because we moved left)
- Scientific notation: $$4.567834 \times 10^6$$

Example 2: A very small number
- Original number: 0.00000000000235 
- Move the decimal point right 12 times: 2.35
- Exponent: −12 (because we moved right)
- Scientific notation: $$2.35 \times 10^{-12}$$

> A number is written in scientific notation if it has the form $$a\times 10^n$$ where $$1\le a < 10$$
