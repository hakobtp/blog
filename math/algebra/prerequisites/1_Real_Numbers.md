In this section, we will explore sets of numbers, calculations with different kinds of numbers, and the use of numbers in expressions.

## Classifying a Real Number

The numbers we use for counting things are called **natural numbers**. These are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5,` and so on. We write them like this:

$${1,2,3,\dots}$$

The **"…"** means the numbers go on forever. That’s why we say natural numbers continue to infinity. 
Natural numbers are also called counting numbers. We use them when we count people on a team, coins in a jar, 
or trees in a forest.

The set of **whole numbers** is the set of natural numbers plus zero: 

$${0, 1,2,3,\dots}$$

The set of **integers** adds the opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers:

$${\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots}$$

> NOTE: Positive integers are the same as natural numbers, and natural numbers are a **subset** of the larger group called integers.

The set of **rational numbers** is written as 

$$\left\{ \frac{m}{n} \,\middle|\, m \text{ and } n \text{ are integers and } n \ne 0 \right\}$$ 

Rational numbers are fractions made of two integers—one on top (the numerator) and one on the bottom (the denominator). But the denominator can never be 0.

Every natural number, whole number, and integer is also a rational number, because you can write it as a fraction with 1 in the denominator. For example, 5 can be written as $$\frac{5}{1}$$.


Since rational numbers are fractions, we can also write them as decimals. Every rational number can be written as either:

- a terminating decimal: $$\frac{15}{8}=1.875$$.
- a repeating decimal: $$\frac{4}{11} = 0.363636\ldots = \overline{0.36}$$.


A long time ago, people discovered that **not all numbers are rational**.

For example, an artist drawing a perfect circle might have realized that the distance around the circle doesn’t divide evenly by the width across it. Or a carpenter measuring a triangle might have found that the longest side doesn’t match any simple fraction—it’s a strange number that can’t be written exactly.

These kinds of numbers are called **irrational numbers** because they cannot be written as a fraction of two integers.

There is no simple rule to describe all irrational numbers. The only thing we can say is: A number is irrational if it **is not rational**.

So, the set of irrational numbers includes all the numbers that cannot be written as a fraction like $$\frac{m}{n}$$ where 
**m** and **n** are integers and $$n \neq 0$$.

Some common examples of irrational numbers are:

- $ \pi $ the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter
- $ \sqrt{2} $, the length of the diagonal in a square with sides of 1 unit
