# Radicals and Rational Exponents

When you square a number (multiply it by itself) and then take its square root, you get the original number back.

$$
4^2 = 16 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \sqrt{16} = 4
$$

The square root is like the **opposite action** of squaring — just like subtraction is the opposite of addition. To “undo” squaring, we take the square root.

- $$\sqrt{}$$ called the **radical**.
