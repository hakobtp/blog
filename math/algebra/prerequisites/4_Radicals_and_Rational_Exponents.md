# Radicals and Rational Exponents

When you square a number (multiply it by itself) and then take its square root, you get the original number back.

$$
4^2 = 16 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \sqrt{16} = 4
$$

The square root is like the **opposite action** of squaring — just like subtraction is the opposite of addition. To “undo” squaring, we take the square root.

- $$\sqrt{}$$ called the **radical**.
- $$a$$ called the **radicand** (the number under the radical).
- $$\sqrt{a}$$ called a **radical expression**.


If $$a$$ is a positive number, the square root of $$a$$ is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals $$a$$.

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a
$$        

It can be **positive** or **negative**, because:

$$4 \times 4 = 16$$ and $$(-4) \times (-4) = 16$$.

However, in most cases, we use the principal square root, which means the nonnegative root. This is what you see on a calculator.
