# Radicals and Rational Exponents

When you square a number (multiply it by itself) and then take its square root, you get the original number back.

$$
4^2 = 16 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \sqrt{16} = 4
$$

The square root is like the **opposite action** of squaring — just like subtraction is the opposite of addition. To “undo” squaring, we take the square root.

- $$\sqrt{}$$ called the **radical**.


> **Principal Square Root**

> The **principal square root** of $$a$$ is the nonnegative number that, when multiplied by itself, equals $$a$$. It is written as a
> **radical expression**, with a symbol called a **radical** over the term called the **radicand**: $$\sqrt{a}$$.
