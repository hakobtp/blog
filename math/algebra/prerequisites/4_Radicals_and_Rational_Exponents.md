# Radicals and Rational Exponents

When you square a number (multiply it by itself) and then take its square root, you get the original number back.

$$
4^2 = 16 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \sqrt{16} = 4
$$

The square root is like the **opposite action** of squaring — just like subtraction is the opposite of addition. To “undo” squaring, we take the square root.

- $$\sqrt{}$$ called the **radical**.
- $$a$$ called the **radicand** (the number under the radical).
- $$\sqrt{a}$$ called a **radical expression**.


If $$a$$ is a positive number, the square root of $$a$$ is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals $$a$$.

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a
$$        

It can be **positive** or **negative**, because: $$4 \times 4 = 16$$ and $$(-4) \times (-4) = 16$$.

However, in most cases, we use the principal square root, which means the nonnegative root. This is what you see on a calculator.

**The Product Rule**

If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are nonnegative, the square root of the product $$ab$$ is equal to the product of the square roots of $$a$$ and $$b$$.
$$
\sqrt{ab}=\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}
$$

**The Quotient Rule**

The square root of the quotient $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is equal to the quotient of the square roots of $$a$$ and $$b$$, where $$b\neq 0$$.

$$
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
$$

**Adding and Subtracting Square Roots**

We can add or subtract radical expressions only when they have the same radicand and when they have the same radical
type such as square roots. For example, the sum of $$\sqrt{2}$$ and $$3\sqrt{2}$$ is $$4\sqrt{2}$$. However, it is often possible 
to simplify radical expressions, and that may change the radicand.

**Example:**

$$
\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{18} = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{9 \times 2} =
$$
