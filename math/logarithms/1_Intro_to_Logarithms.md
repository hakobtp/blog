You will learn what logarithms are, and evaluate some basic logarithms.
This will prepare you for future work with logarithm expressions and functions.

## What is a logarithm?

Logarithms are another way of thinking about exponents. 
For example, we know that $$2$$ raised to the $$4^{th}$$ power equals $$16$$. 
expressed by the **exponential** equation $$2^4=16$$.

Now, suppose someone asked us, `"raised to which power equals 16?"` The answer would be $$4$$. 
This is expressed by the **logarithmic** equation $$\log_{2}(16)=4$$, read as `"log base two of sixteen is four"`.

$$
2^4 =16 \Leftrightarrow \log_{2}(16)=4
$$

Both equations describe the same relationship between the numbers 2, 4 and 16, where 2 is the **base** and 4 is the **exponent**. 
The difference is that while the exponential form isolates the power, 16, the logarithmic form isolates the exponent, 4.

Here are more examples of equivalent logarithmic and exponential equations.

|Logarithmic form|Exponential form|
|:---------------|:---------------|
|$$\log_{2}(8)=3$$|$$2^3=8$$|
|$$\log_{3}(81)=4$$|$$3^4=81$$|
|$$\log_{5}(25)=2$$|$$5^2=25$$|

## Definition of a logarithm

Generalizing the examples above leads us to the formal definition of a logarithm.

$$
 \log_{\textcolor{red}{b}}(\textcolor{orange}{a}) = \textcolor{blue}{c} \Leftrightarrow \textcolor{red}{b}^{\textcolor{blue}{c}} = \textcolor{orange}{a}
$$

Both equations describe the same relationship between $$\textcolor{orange}{a}$$, $$\textcolor{red}{b}$$, and $$\textcolor{blue}{c}$$:

- $$\textcolor{red}{b} $$ is the base.
- $$\textcolor{blue}{c}$$ is the exponent.
- $$\textcolor{orange}{a}$$ is called the argument
