You will learn what logarithms are, and evaluate some basic logarithms.
This will prepare you for future work with logarithm expressions and functions.

## What is a logarithm?

Logarithms are another way of thinking about exponents. 
For example, we know that $$2$$ raised to the $$4^{th}$$ power equals $$16$$. 
expressed by the **exponential** equation $$2^4=16$$.

Now, suppose someone asked us, `"raised to which power equals 16?"` The answer would be $$4$$. 
This is expressed by the **logarithmic** equation $$\log_{2}(16)=4$$, read as `"log base two of sixteen is four"`.

    $$2^4 =16 \Leftrightarrow \log_{2}(16)=4$$
